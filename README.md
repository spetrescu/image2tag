# image2tag
This repository contains the code associated with the "[Caption images using LSTMs](https://spetrescu.github.io/image-captioning-using-lstms/)" blog post.

## Code
Find the code required to trained the network under `src/`.<br>
To run the code, you need to have CUDA available on your machine. If that's the case, (1) clone this repository, (2) open `src/image_captioning_using_lstms.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook, and (3) execute all the code cells.
However, if CUDA is not available on your machine, run the code in Google Colab [here](https://githubtocolab.com/spetrescu/image2tag/blob/main/src/image_captioning_using_lstms.ipynb).

## Trained model
If you don't have the appropriate resources to run the code, you can find the trained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4wzJLqM6LZjj83FDrxBPopwdDLMf6xM/view?usp=sharing).
